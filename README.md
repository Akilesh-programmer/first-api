# first-api
 This is a simple API. We have a database called cafe.db. In that we have a number of cafes and details related to them. Then we have built an API to interact with the database. Point to be noted is that this will work only locally. For doing that you need to run the main.py file, this is a flask hosted website, so you can paste the link which flask gives you in the terminal after running.

 # Documentation

 # POSTMAN
 The simple way to interact with this API is to use POSTMAN itself.
